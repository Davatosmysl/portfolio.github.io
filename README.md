# My portfolio website
I have built this website to have a place to host my portfolio projects.

## Structure of the website will be as follows

A single, long page divided into 3 section.

1. section
   => A floating navigation bar with three parts
   - Intro
   - Projects
   - Contacts
   => Headline with my name and image and a short introductory paragraph
2. section
   => Grid with names, links and images of my projects
3. section
   => My contact details
